          You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
          determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched
          return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much information as
          possible to make this determination one way or the other. We will
          provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for you to get a
          feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk
          about their experience.

        <p class="implem-p avenir implem-p-2 margin-right-left-auto">
          Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
          community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
          number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghourse, and getting
          bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred
          specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending referrals
          and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health
          information exchanges or other information technology vendors are
          important, we will work with you to determine what we can deliver
          and when.

        <p class="implem-p avenir implem-p-3 margin-right-left-auto">
          The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backdrop of your
          current data, which we have executed successfully with both remotely
          hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then our work begins to import
          into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like medications,
          problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. While importing
          clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has been
          able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.

          We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical
          content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be
          done a few weeks prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members
          with clinical, practice management, and billing workflows. Either before
          or during go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work
          side-by-side with you on implementation and training.

          Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice.
          We will be with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your
          preference, to make sure everything goes smoothly. There is always fine
          tuning to do once you have a handful of encounters in Canvas under
          your belt: changing clinical mircotemplates, setting up new automations,
          modifying practice management settings, and more. We are here to help
          with it all.

          All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises
          and provide support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means
          that if we are not meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement
          and receive all payments back. (We do not expect this to happen). For
          our Standard plans, we also offer a MIPS guarantee: if you receive a
          negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for everyone, we provide
          unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a long,
          productive partnership for us both.
