User can sign up:
Post request is sent; checks to make sure that a password and username are
included. Hashes the password. Inserts the username and password into a row in the
database.

User can sign in:
Post request is sent. Checks that both a username and password are included. Queries the
database and checks if the user exists, then if the entered password will match the
hashed password. If it matches, the client is given a token. Token is saved in local
storage. User state is set to the current user.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page):
When the component mounts, checks if the user has a token. If the user has a token,
the user state is set to that user and they are redirected to the "home" (gif) page.

User can sign out:
Removes the token from local storage. User state is set to null. User is returned
to the log in page where they can sign in again or sign up.
